# Styling

PrimeVue has a lot of styling possiblities and the structure of a formkit form gives you all possibilities needed for advanced styling.

## Basic Styling

Basic styling is provided with the **formkit-primevue.scss** file.

Features:

- Width of all text and dropdown elements is set to 100%
- Error Color by variable (--formkit-error-color)
- Some margins, font sizes ...

You can use it or take it as base for your own styling.

## PrimeVue Tailwind / Unstyled mode

Make sure to add a class selector for **p-invalid**.
